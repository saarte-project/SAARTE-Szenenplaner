Licensing Rules for Assets
==========================

We need to adhere to "2. END-USER's Rights and Obligations" of Unity's [EULA](https://unity3d.com/legal/as_terms). It currently states

    Licensor grants to the END-USER a non-exclusive, worldwide, and perpetual license to the Asset to integrate it only as incorporated and embedded components of electronic games and digital media and distribute such electronic game and digital media; reproduction and display in distributed physical advertising materials is permitted solely for marketing purposes in respect of such electronic games or digital media. Except for game services software development kits (“Services SDKs”), END-USERS may modify Assets. END-USER may otherwise not reproduce, publicly display, publicly perform, transmit, distribute, sublicense, rent, lease or lend the Assets. It is emphasized that the END-USERS shall not be entitled to distribute or transfer in any way (including, without, limitation by way of sublicense) the Assets in any other way than as integrated components of electronic games and digital media or in supporting physical marketing materials. Without limitation of the foregoing it is emphasized that END-USER shall not be entitled to share the costs related to purchasing an Asset and then let any third party that has contributed to such purchase use such Asset (forum pooling).
    
This means this app and its module can only be put open source **whithout the assets** from the store or if special license permits us to do so.

Further Unity has a number of interesting points in their license FAQ: https://support.unity3d.com/hc/en-us/categories/201268913-Licenses
